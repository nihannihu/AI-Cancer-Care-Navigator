# Onco-Navigator AI - Bridging India's Cancer Care Gap

An AI-powered cancer care platform that streamlines early detection and specialist referral through three core pillars:
1. AI-Assisted Triage for Primary Care  
2. Tele-Oncology Hub for Specialists
3. Patient Monitoring & Symptom Tracking

## Features

- **AI-Powered Mammography Analysis**: CNN model for breast cancer detection
- **Geolocation-Based Emergency Services**: Find nearest hospitals with real-time location
- **Patient Symptom Monitoring**: Daily check-in system for ongoing care
- **Tele-Oncology Workflow**: Streamlined communication between PCPs and oncologists
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Professional medical UI with mobile support

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Database**: MongoDB (optional)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Jinja2 templating
- **APIs**: Geoapify for geolocation services
- **Deployment**: Uvicorn server

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)
- MongoDB account (optional, for data persistence)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cancer-mega-project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit `.env` and add your configuration:
     ```
     GEOAPIFY_API_KEY=your_geoapify_api_key_here
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
     ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app_main.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
